## How to Contribute

FontTools development is on-going in an active community of developers, that includes professional developers employed at major software corporations and at type foundries, as well as hobbyists.

The project is run on Github, in the typical free/libre/open-source software way. 
If you are unfamiliar with that, check out [opensource.guide](https://opensource.guide) and [producingoss.com](http://producingoss.com).

We use Github's Issue Tracker to report, discuss and track bugs, map out future improvements, set priorities, and self-assign issues.
If you find a bug, have an idea for a new feature, then please [create a new issue](https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues) and we'll be happy to work with you on it!

If you have a question or want to discuss usage from an end-user perspective, there is a mailing list at [groups.google.com/d/forum/fonttools](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/fonttools) mailing list.

If you would like to speak to someone directly, you can also email the project lead, Behdad Esfahbod, privately at <behdad@behdad.org>

If you make a pull request, you (or the organization that owns your copyrights) should be listed in the [README](https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools#copyrights).

(There is also a development [groups.google.com/d/forum/fonttools-dev](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/fonttools-dev) mailing list for Continuous Integration notifications.)
