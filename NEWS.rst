----------------------------
- [subset] subsetter bug fix with variable fonts.
- [varLib.featureVar] Improve FeatureVariations generation with many rules.

3.32.0 (released 2018-11-01)
----------------------------

- [ufoLib] Make ``UFOWriter`` a subclass of ``UFOReader``, and use mixins
  for shared methods (#1344).
- [featureVars] Fixed normalization error when a condition's minimum/maximum
  attributes are missing in designspace ``<rule>`` (#1366).
- [setup.py] Added ``[plot]`` to extras, to optionally install ``matplotlib``,
  needed to use the ``fonTools.varLib.plot`` module.
- [varLib] Take total bounding box into account when resolving model (7ee81c8).
  If multiple axes have the same range ratio, cut across both (62003f4).
- [subset] Don't error if ``STAT`` has no ``AxisValue`` tables.
- [fontBuilder] Added a new submodule which contains a ``FontBuilder`` wrapper
  class around ``TTFont`` that makes it easier to create a working TTF or OTF
  font from scratch with code. NOTE: the API is still experimental and may
  change in future versions.

3.31.0 (released 2018-10-21)
----------------------------

- [ufoLib] Merged the `ufoLib <https://github.com/unified-font-objects/ufoLib>`__
  master branch into a new ``fontTools.ufoLib`` package (#1335, #1095).
  Moved ``ufoLib.pointPen`` module to ``fontTools.pens.pointPen``.
  Moved ``ufoLib.etree`` module to ``fontTools.misc.etree``.
  Moved ``ufoLib.plistlib`` module to ``fontTools.misc.plistlib``.
  To use the new ``fontTools.ufoLib`` module you need to install fonttools
  with the ``[ufo]`` extra, or you can manually install the required additional
  dependencies (cf. README.rst).
- [morx] Support AAT action type to insert glyphs and clean up compilation
  of AAT action tables (4a1871f, 2011ccf).
- [subset] The ``--no-hinting`` on a CFF font now also drops the optional

- [feaLib] Skip building noop class PairPos subtables when Coverage is NULL
  (#1318).
- [ttx] Expose the previously reserved bit flag ``OVERLAP_SIMPLE`` of
  glyf table's contour points in the TTX dump. This is used in some
  implementations to specify a non-zero fill with overlapping contours (#1316).
- [ttLib] Added support for decompiling/compiling ``TS1C`` tables containing
  VTT sources for ``cvar`` variation table (#1310).
- [varLib] Use ``fontTools.designspaceLib`` to read DesignSpaceDocument. The
  ``fontTools.varLib.designspace`` module is now deprecated and will be removed
  in future versions. The presence of an explicit ``axes`` element is now
  required in order to build a variable font (#1224, #1313).
- [varLib] Implemented building GSUB FeatureVariations table from the ``rules``
  element of DesignSpace document (#1240, #713, #1314).
- [subset] Added ``--no-layout-closure`` option to not expand the subset with
  the glyphs produced by OpenType layout features. Instead, OpenType features
  will be subset to only rules that are relevant to the otherwise-specified
  glyph set (#43, #1121).

3.29.1 (released 2018-09-10)
----------------------------

- [feaLib] Fixed issue whereby lookups from DFLT/dflt were not included in the
  DFLT/non-dflt language systems (#1307).
- [graphite] Fixed issue on big-endian architectures (e.g. ppc64) (#1311).
- [subset] Added ``--layout-scripts`` option to add/exclude set of OpenType
  layout scripts that will be preserved. By default all scripts are retained
  (``'*'``) (#1303).

3.29.0 (released 2018-07-26)
----------------------------

- [feaLib] In the OTL table builder, when the ``name`` table is excluded
  from the list of tables to be build, skip compiling ``featureNames`` blocks,
  as the records referenced in ``FeatureParams`` table don't exist (68951b7).
- [otBase] Try ``ExtensionLookup`` if other offset-overflow methods fail
  (05f95f0).
- [feaLib] Added support for explicit ``subtable;`` break statements in
  PairPos lookups; previously these were ignored (#1279, #1300, #1302).
- [cffLib.specializer] Make sure the stack depth does not exceed maxstack - 1,
  so that a subroutinizer can insert subroutine calls (#1301,
  https://github.com/googlei18n/ufo2ft/issues/266).
- [otTables] Added support for fixing offset overflow errors occurring inside
  ``MarkBasePos`` subtables (#1297).
- [subset] Write the default output file extension based on ``--flavor`` option,
  or the value of ``TTFont.sfntVersion`` (d7ac0ad).
- [unicodedata] Updated Blocks, Scripts and ScriptExtensions for Unicode 11
  (452c85e).
- [xmlWriter] Added context manager to XMLWriter class to autoclose file
  descriptor on exit (#1290).

  all float values that have no decimal portion (8d7774a).
- [ttFont] Fixed missing import of ``TTLibError`` exception (#1285).
- [feaLib] Allow any languages other than ``dflt`` under ``DFLT`` script
  (#1278, #1292).

3.28.0 (released 2018-06-19)
----------------------------

- [featureVars] Added experimental module to build ``FeatureVariations``
  tables. Still needs to be hooked up to ``varLib.build`` (#1240).
- [fixedTools] Added ``otRound`` to round floats to nearest integer towards
  positive Infinity. This is now used where we deal with visual data like X/Y
  coordinates, advance widths/heights, variation deltas, and similar (#1274,
  #1248).
- [subset] Improved GSUB closure memoize algorithm.
- [varLib.models] Fixed regression in model resolution (180124, #1269).
- [feaLib.ast] Fixed error when converting ``SubtableStatement`` to string
  (#1275).
- [varLib.mutator] Set ``OS/2.usWeightClass`` and ``usWidthClass``, and
  ``post.italicAngle`` based on the 'wght', 'wdth' and 'slnt' axis values
  (#1276, #1264).
- [py23/loggingTools] Don't automatically set ``logging.lastResort`` handler
  on py27. Moved ``LastResortLogger`` to the ``loggingTools`` module (#1277).

3.27.1 (released 2018-06-11)
----------------------------

- [ttGlyphPen] Issue a warning and skip building non-existing components
  (https://github.com/googlei18n/fontmake/issues/411).
- [tests] Fixed issue running ttx_test.py from a tagged commit.

3.27.0 (released 2018-06-11)
----------------------------

- [designspaceLib] Added new ``conditionSet`` element to ``rule`` element in
  designspace document. Bumped ``format`` attribute to ``4.0`` (previously,
  it was formatted as an integer). Removed ``checkDefault``, ``checkAxes``
  methods, and any kind of guessing about the axes when the ``<axes>`` element
  is missing. The default master is expected at the intersection of all default
  values for each axis (#1254, #1255, #1267).
- [cffLib] Fixed issues when compiling CFF2 or converting from CFF when the
  font has an FDArray (#1211, #1271).
- [varLib] Avoid attempting to build ``cvar`` table when ``glyf`` table is not
  present, as is the case for CFF2 fonts.
- [subset] Handle None coverages in MarkGlyphSets; revert commit 02616ab that
  sets empty Coverage tables in MarkGlyphSets to None, to make OTS happy.
- [ttFont] Allow to build glyph order from ``maxp.numGlyphs`` when ``post`` or
  ``cmap`` are missing.
- [ttFont] Added ``__len__`` method to ``_TTGlyphSet``.
- [glyf] Ensure ``GlyphCoordinates`` never overflow signed shorts (#1230).

- [loggingTools] Memoize ``log`` property of ``LogMixin`` class (fbab12).
- [ttx] Impoved test coverage (#1261).
- [Snippets] Addded script to append a suffix to all family names in a font.
- [varLib.plot] Make it work with matplotlib >= 2.1 (b38e2b).

3.26.0 (released 2018-05-03)
----------------------------

- [designspace] Added a new optional ``layer`` attribute to the source element,
  and a corresponding ``layerName`` attribute to the ``SourceDescriptor``
  object (#1253).
  Added ``conditionset`` element to the ``rule`` element to the spec, but not
  implemented in designspace reader/writer yet (#1254).
- [varLib.models] Refine modeling one last time (0ecf5c5).
- [otBase] Fixed sharing of tables referred to by different offset sizes
  (795f2f9).
- [subset] Don't drop a GDEF that only has VarStore (fc819d6). Set to None
  empty Coverage tables in MarkGlyphSets (02616ab).
- [varLib]: Added ``--master-finder`` command-line option (#1249).
- [varLib.mutator] Prune fvar nameIDs from instance's name table (#1245).
- [otTables] Allow decompiling bad ClassDef tables with invalid format, with
  warning (#1236).
- [varLib] Make STAT v1.2 and reuse nameIDs from fvar table (#1242).
- [varLib.plot] Show master locations. Set axis limits to -1, +1.
- [subset] Handle HVAR direct mapping. Passthrough 'cvar'.
  Added ``--font-number`` command-line option for collections.
- [t1Lib] Allow a text encoding to be specified when parsing a Type 1 font
  (#1234). Added ``kind`` argument to T1Font constructor (c5c161c).
- [ttLib] Added context manager API to ``TTFont`` class, so it can be used in
  ``with`` statements to auto-close the file when exiting the context (#1232).

3.25.0 (released 2018-04-03)
----------------------------

- [varLib] Improved support-resolution algorithm. Previously, the on-axis
  masters would always cut the space. They don't anymore. That's more
  consistent, and fixes the main issue Erik showed at TYPO Labs 2017.
  Any varfont built that had an unusual master configuration will change
  when rebuilt (42bef17, a523a697,
  https://github.com/googlei18n/fontmake/issues/264).
- [varLib.models] Added a ``main()`` entry point, that takes positions and
  prints model results.
- [varLib.plot] Added new module to plot a designspace's
  VariationModel. Requires ``matplotlib``.
- [varLib.mutator] Added -o option to specify output file path (2ef60fa).
- [otTables] Fixed IndexError while pruning of HVAR pre-write (6b6c34a).
- [varLib.models] Convert delta array to floats if values overflows signed
  short integer (0055f94).

3.24.2 (released 2018-03-26)
----------------------------

- [otBase] Don't fail during ``ValueRecord`` copy if src has more items.
  We drop hinting in the subsetter by simply changing ValueFormat, without
  cleaning up the actual ValueRecords. This was causing assertion error if
  a variable font was subsetted without hinting and then passed directly to
  the mutator for instantiation without first it saving to disk.

3.24.1 (released 2018-03-06)
----------------------------

- [varLib] Don't remap the same ``DeviceTable`` twice in VarStore optimizer
  (#1206).
- [varLib] Add ``--disable-iup`` option to ``fonttools varLib`` script,
  and a ``optimize=True`` keyword argument to ``varLib.build`` function,
  to optionally disable IUP optimization while building varfonts.
- [ttCollection] Fixed issue while decompiling ttc with python3 (#1207).

3.24.0 (released 2018-03-01)
----------------------------

- [ttGlyphPen] Decompose composite glyphs if any components' transform is too
  large to fit a ``F2Dot14`` value, or clamp transform values that are
  (almost) equal to +2.0 to make them fit and avoid decomposing (#1200,
  #1204, #1205).
- [ttx] Added new ``-g`` option to dump glyphs from the ``glyf`` table
  splitted as individual ttx files (#153, #1035, #1132, #1202).
- Copied ``ufoLib.filenames`` module to ``fontTools.misc.filenames``, used
  for the ttx split-glyphs option (#1202).
- [feaLib] Added support for ``cvParameters`` blocks in Character Variant
  feautures ``cv01-cv99`` (#860, #1169).
- [Snippets] Added ``checksum.py`` script to generate/check SHA1 hash of
  ttx files (#1197).
- [varLib.mutator] Fixed issue while instantiating some variable fonts
  whereby the horizontal advance width computed from ``gvar`` phantom points
  could turn up to be negative (#1198).
- [varLib/subset] Fixed issue with subsetting GPOS variation data not
  picking up ``ValueRecord`` ``Device`` objects (54fd71f).
- [feaLib/voltLib] In all AST elements, the ``location`` is no longer a
  required positional argument, but an optional kewyord argument (defaults
  to ``None``). This will make it easier to construct feature AST from
  code (#1201).


3.23.0 (released 2018-02-26)
----------------------------

- [designspaceLib] Added an optional ``lib`` element to the designspace as a
  whole, as well as to the instance elements, to store arbitrary data in a
  property list dictionary, similar to the UFO's ``lib``. Added an optional
  ``font`` attribute to the ``SourceDescriptor``, to allow operating on
  in-memory font objects (#1175).
- [cffLib] Fixed issue with lazy-loading of attributes when attempting to
  set the CFF TopDict.Encoding (#1177, #1187).
- [ttx] Fixed regression introduced in 3.22.0 that affected the split tables
  ``-s`` option (#1188).
- [feaLib] Added ``IncludedFeaNotFound`` custom exception subclass, raised
  when an included feature file cannot be found (#1186).
- [otTables] Changed ``VarIdxMap`` to use glyph names internally instead of
  glyph indexes. The old ttx dumps of HVAR/VVAR tables that contain indexes
  can still be imported (21cbab8, 38a0ffb).
- [varLib] Implemented VarStore optimizer (#1184).
- [subset] Implemented pruning of GDEF VarStore, HVAR and MVAR (#1179).
- [sfnt] Restore backward compatiblity with ``numFonts`` attribute of
  ``SFNTReader`` object (#1181).
- [merge] Initial support for merging ``LangSysRecords`` (#1180).
- [ttCollection] don't seek(0) when writing to possibly unseekable strems.
- [subset] Keep all ``--name-IDs`` from 0 to 6 by default (#1170, #605, #114).
- [cffLib] Added ``width`` module to calculate optimal CFF default and
  nominal glyph widths.
- [varLib] Don’t fail if STAT already in the master fonts (#1166).

3.22.0 (released 2018-02-04)
----------------------------

- [subset] Support subsetting ``endchar`` acting as ``seac``-like components
  in ``CFF`` (fixes #1162).
- [feaLib] Allow to build from pre-parsed ``ast.FeatureFile`` object.
  Added ``tables`` argument to only build some tables instead of all (#1159,
  #1163).
- [textTools] Replaced ``safeEval`` with ``ast.literal_eval`` (#1139).
- [feaLib] Added option to the parser to not resolve ``include`` statements
  (#1154).
- [ttLib] Added new ``ttCollection`` module to read/write TrueType and
  OpenType Collections. Exports a ``TTCollection`` class with a ``fonts``
  attribute containing a list of ``TTFont`` instances, the methods ``save``
  and ``saveXML``, plus some list-like methods. The ``importXML`` method is
  not implemented yet (#17).
- [unicodeadata] Added ``ot_tag_to_script`` function that converts from
  OpenType script tag to Unicode script code.
- Added new ``designspaceLib`` subpackage, originally from Erik Van Blokland's
  ``designSpaceDocument``: https://github.com/LettError/designSpaceDocument
  NOTE: this is not yet used internally by varLib, and the API may be subject
  to changes (#911, #1110, LettError/designSpaceDocument#28).
- Added new FontTools icon images (8ee7c32).
- [unicodedata] Added ``script_horizontal_direction`` function that returns
  either "LTR" or "RTL" given a unicode script code.
- [otConverters] Don't write descriptive name string as XML comment if the
  NameID value is 0 (== NULL) (#1151, #1152).
- [unicodedata] Add ``ot_tags_from_script`` function to get the list of
  OpenType script tags associated with unicode script code (#1150).
- [feaLib] Don't error when "enumerated" kern pairs conflict with preceding
  single pairs; emit warning and chose the first value (#1147, #1148).
- [loggingTools] In ``CapturingLogHandler.assertRegex`` method, match the
  fully formatted log message.
- [sbix] Fixed TypeError when concatenating str and bytes (#1154).
- [bezierTools] Implemented cusp support and removed ``approximate_fallback``
  arg in ``calcQuadraticArcLength``. Added ``calcCubicArcLength`` (#1142).

3.21.2 (released 2018-01-08)
----------------------------

- [varLib] Fixed merging PairPos Format1/2 with missing subtables (#1125).

3.21.1 (released 2018-01-03)
----------------------------

- [feaLib] Allow mixed single/multiple substitutions (#612)
- Added missing ``*.afm`` test assets to MAINFEST.in (#1137).
- Fixed dumping ``SVG`` tables containing color palettes (#1124).

3.21.0 (released 2017-12-18)
----------------------------

- [cmap] when compiling format6 subtable, don't assume gid0 is always called
  '.notdef' (1e42224).
- [ot] Allow decompiling fonts with bad Coverage format number (1aafae8).
- Change FontTools licence to MIT (#1127).

3.20.1 (released 2017-11-22)
----------------------------

- [unicodedata] Fixed issue with ``script`` and ``script_extension`` functions
  returning inconsistent short vs long names. They both return the short four-
  letter script codes now. Added ``script_name`` and ``script_code`` functions
  to look up the long human-readable script name from the script code, and
  viceversa (#1109, #1111).

3.20.0 (released 2017-11-21)
----------------------------

- [unicodedata] Addded new module ``fontTools.unicodedata`` which exports the
  same interface as the built-in ``unicodedata`` module, with the addition of
  a few functions that are missing from the latter, such as ``script``,
  ``script_extension`` and ``block``. Added a ``MetaTools/buildUCD.py`` script
  to download and parse data files from the Unicode Character Database and
  generate python modules containing lists of ranges and property values.
- [feaLib] Added ``__str__`` method to all ``ast`` elements (delegates to the
  ``asFea`` method).
- [feaLib] ``Parser`` constructor now accepts a ``glyphNames`` iterable
  instead of ``glyphMap`` dict. The latter still works but with a pending
  deprecation warning (#1104).
- [bezierTools] Added arc length calculation functions originally from
  ``pens.perimeterPen`` module (#1101).
- [varLib] Started generating STAT table (8af4309). Right now it just reflects
  the axes, and even that with certain limitations:
  * AxisOrdering is set to the order axes are defined,
  * Name-table entries are not shared with fvar.
- [py23] Added backports for ``redirect_stdout`` and ``redirect_stderr``
  context managers (#1097).
- [Graphite] Fixed some round-trip bugs (#1093).

3.19.0 (released 2017-11-06)
----------------------------

- [varLib] Try set of used points instead of all points when testing whether to
  share points between tuples (#1090).
- [CFF2] Fixed issue with reading/writing PrivateDict BlueValues to TTX file.
  Read the commit message 8b02b5a and issue #1030 for more details.
  NOTE: this change invalidates all the TTX files containing CFF2 tables
  that where dumped with previous verisons of fonttools.
  CFF2 Subr items can have values on the stack after the last operator, thus
  a ``CFF2Subr`` class was added to accommodate this (#1091).
- [_k_e_r_n] Fixed compilation of AAT kern version=1.0 tables (#1089, #1094)
- [ttLib] Added getBestCmap() convenience method to TTFont class and cmap table
  class that returns a preferred Unicode cmap subtable given a list of options
  (#1092).
- [morx] Emit more meaningful subtable flags. Implement InsertionMorphAction

  into SVG path descriptions. Copied from Tal Leming's ``ufo2svg.svgPathPen``
  https://github.com/typesupply/ufo2svg/blob/d69f992/Lib/ufo2svg/svgPathPen.py
- [reverseContourPen] Added ``ReverseContourPen``, a filter pen that draws
  contours with the winding direction reversed, while keeping the starting
  point (#1071).
- [filterPen] Added ``ContourFilterPen`` to manipulate contours as a whole
  rather than segment by segment.
- [arrayTools] Added ``Vector`` class to apply math operations on an array
  of numbers, and ``pairwise`` function to loop over pairs of items in an
  iterable.
- [varLib] Added support for building and interpolation of ``cvar`` table
  (f874cf6, a25a401).

3.16.0 (released 2017-10-03)
----------------------------

3.15.1 (released 2017-08-18)
----------------------------

- [otConverters] Implemented ``__add__`` and ``__radd__`` methods on
  ``otConverters._LazyList`` that decompile a lazy list before adding
  it to another list or ``_LazyList`` instance. Fixes an ``AttributeError``

  (6ef48bd2, 1aef1683).
- [AAT] Support the `opbd` table with optical bounds (a47f6588).
- [AAT] Support `prop` table with glyph properties (d05617b4).


3.15.0 (released 2017-08-17)
----------------------------

  ``interpolate_layout`` to allow disabling avar mapping: if False (default),
  the location is mapped using the map element of the axes in designspace file;
  if True, it is assumed that location is in designspace's internal space and
  no mapping is performed (#950, #975).

----------------------------

- [t2CharStringPen] Initial support for specialized Type2 path operators:

  added before when glyphsLib was always exporting the (unused) custom axis.
- [varLib] Added partial support for building ``MVAR`` table; does not
  implement ``gasp`` table variations yet.
- [pens] Added FilterPen base class, for pens that control another pen;
  factored out ``addComponent`` method from BasePen into a separate abstract
  DecomposingPen class; added DecomposingRecordingPen, which records
  components decomposed as regular contours.
- [TSI1] Fixed computation of the textLength of VTT private tables (#913).
- [loggingTools] Added ``LogMixin`` class providing a ``log`` property to
  subclasses, which returns a ``logging.Logger`` named after the latter.

3.3.1 (released 2016-12-15)
---------------------------

-  [setup] We no longer use versioneer.py to compute fonttools version
   from git metadata, as this has caused issues for some users (#767).
   Now we bump the version strings manually with a custom ``release``
   command of setup.py script.

   XML output for GSUB, GPOS, GDEF, MATH, BASE, JSTF, HVAR, VVAR, feat,
   hhea and vhea tables. Scripts that set the Version for those to 1.0
   or other float values also need fixing. A warning is emitted when
   code or XML needs fix.
-  several bug fixes to the cffLib module, contributed by Adobe's
   @readroberts
-  The XML output for CFF table now has a 'major' and 'minor' elements
   for specifying whether it's version 1.0 or 2.0 (support for CFF2 is
   coming soon)
-  [setup.py] remove undocumented/deprecated ``extra_path`` Distutils
   argument. This means that we no longer create a "FontTools" subfolder
   in site-packages containing the actual fontTools package, as well as
   the standalone xmlWriter and sstruct modules. The latter modules are
   also deprecated, and scheduled for removal in upcoming releases.
   Please change your import statements to point to from fontTools.misc
   import xmlWriter and from fontTools.misc import sstruct.
-  [scripts] Add a 'fonttools' command-line tool that simply runs
   ``fontTools.*`` sub-modules: e.g. ``fonttools ttx``,
   ``fonttools subset``, etc.
-  [hmtx/vmts] Read advance width/heights as unsigned short (uint16);
   automatically round float values to integers.
-  [ttLib/xmlWriter] add 'newlinestr=None' keyword argument to
   ``TTFont.saveXML`` for overriding os-specific line endings (passed on
   to ``XMLWriter`` instances).
-  [versioning] Use versioneer instead of ``setuptools_scm`` to
   dynamically load version info from a git checkout at import time.

-  cmap format 1 support
-  PFA font support
-  Switched from Numeric to numpy
-  Update Unicode data to 5.1.0
-  Update AGLFN data to 1.6
-  Many bug fixes

2.1 (released 2008-01-28)
-------------------------

-  Many years worth of fixes and features

2.0b2 (released 2002-??-??)
---------------------------

-  Be "forgiving" when interpreting the maxp table version field:
   interpret any value as 1.0 if it's not 0.5. Fixes dumping of these
   GPL fonts: http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/pds.cgi?ports/chinese/wangttf
-  Fixed ttx -l: it turned out this part of the code didn't work with
   Python 2.2.1 and earlier. My bad to do most of my testing with a
   different version than I shipped TTX with :-(
-  Fixed bug in ClassDef format 1 subtable (Andreas Seidel bumped into
   this one).

2.0b1 (released 2002-09-10)
---------------------------

-  Fixed embarrassing bug: the master checksum in the head table is now
   calculated correctly even on little-endian platforms (such as Intel).
-  Made the cmap format 4 compiler smarter: the binary data it creates
   is now more or less as compact as possible. TTX now makes more
   compact data than in any shipping font I've tested it with.
-  Dump glyph names as a separate "GlyphOrder" pseudo table as opposed
   to as part of the glyf table (obviously needed for CFF-OTF's).
-  Added proper support for the CFF table.
-  Don't barf on empty tables (questionable, but "there are font out
   there...")
-  When writing TT glyf data, align glyphs on 4-byte boundaries. This
   seems to be the current recommendation by MS. Also: don't barf on
   fonts which are already 4-byte aligned.
-  Windows installer contributed bu Adam Twardoch! Yay!
-  Changed the command line interface again, now by creating one new
   tool replacing the old ones: ttx It dumps and compiles, depending on
   input file types. The options have changed somewhat.
-  The -d option is back (output dir)
-  ttcompile's -i options is now called -m (as in "merge"), to avoid
   clash with dump's -i.
-  The -s option ("split tables") no longer creates a directory, but
   instead outputs a small .ttx file containing references to the
   individual table files. This is not a true link, it's a simple file
   name, and the referenced file should be in the same directory so
   ttcompile can find them.
-  compile no longer accepts a directory as input argument. Instead it
   can parse the new "mini-ttx" format as output by "ttx -s".
-  all arguments are input files
-  Renamed the command line programs and moved them to the Tools
   subdirectory. They are now installed by the setup.py install script.
-  Added OpenType support. BASE, GDEF, GPOS, GSUB and JSTF are (almost)
   fully supported. The XML output is not yet final, as I'm still
   considering to output certain subtables in a more human-friendly
   manner.
-  Fixed 'kern' table to correctly accept subtables it doesn't know
   about, as well as interpreting Apple's definition of the 'kern' table
   headers correctly.
-  Fixed bug where glyphnames were not calculated from 'cmap' if it was
   (one of the) first tables to be decompiled. More specifically: it
   cmap was the first to ask for a glyphID -> glyphName mapping.
-  Switched XML parsers: use expat instead of xmlproc. Should be faster.
-  Removed my UnicodeString object: I now require Python 2.0 or up,
   which has unicode support built in.
-  Removed assert in glyf table: redundant data at the end of the table
   is now ignored instead of raising an error. Should become a warning.
-  Fixed bug in hmtx/vmtx code that only occured if all advances were
   equal.
-  Fixed subtle bug in TT instruction disassembler.
-  Couple of fixes to the 'post' table.
-  Updated OS/2 table to latest spec.

1.0b1 (released 2001-08-10)
---------------------------

-  Reorganized the command line interface for ttDump.py and
   ttCompile.py, they now behave more like "normal" command line tool,
   in that they accept multiple input files for batch processing.
-  ttDump.py and ttCompile.py don't silently override files anymore, but
   ask before doing so. Can be overridden by -f.
-  Added -d option to both ttDump.py and ttCompile.py.
-  Installation is now done with distutils. (Needs work for environments
   without compilers.)
-  Updated installation instructions.
-  Added some workarounds so as to handle certain buggy fonts more
   gracefully.
-  Updated Unicode table to Unicode 3.0 (Thanks Antoine!)
-  Included a Python script by Adam Twardoch that adds some useful stuff
   to the Windows registry.
-  Moved the project to SourceForge.

1.0a6 (released 2000-03-15)
---------------------------

-  Big reorganization: made ttLib a subpackage of the new fontTools
   package, changed several module names. Called the entire suite
   "FontTools"
-  Added several submodules to fontTools, some new, some older.
-  Added experimental CFF/GPOS/GSUB support to ttLib, read-only (but XML
   dumping of GPOS/GSUB is for now disabled)
-  Fixed hdmx endian bug
-  Added -b option to ttCompile.py, it disables recalculation of
   bounding boxes, as requested by Werner Lemberg.
-  Renamed tt2xml.pt to ttDump.py and xml2tt.py to ttCompile.py
-  Use ".ttx" as file extension instead of ".xml".
-  TTX is now the name of the XML-based *format* for TT fonts, and not
   just an application.

1.0a5
-----

Never released

-  More tables supported: hdmx, vhea, vmtx

1.0a3 & 1.0a4
-------------

Never released

-  fixed most portability issues
-  retracted the "Euro_or_currency" change from 1.0a2: it was
   nonsense!

1.0a2 (released 1999-05-02)
---------------------------

-  binary release for MacOS
-  genenates full FOND resources: including width table, PS font name
   info and kern table if applicable.
-  added cmap format 4 support. Extra: dumps Unicode char names as XML
   comments!
-  added cmap format 6 support
-  now accepts true type files starting with "true" (instead of just
   0x00010000 and "OTTO")
-  'glyf' table support is now complete: I added support for composite
   scale, xy-scale and two-by-two for the 'glyf' table. For now,
   component offset scale behaviour defaults to Apple-style. This only
   affects the (re)calculation of the glyph bounding box.
-  changed "Euro" to "Euro_or_currency" in the Standard Apple Glyph
   order list, since we cannot tell from the 'post' table which is
   meant. I should probably doublecheck with a Unicode encoding if
   available. (This does not affect the output!)

Fixed bugs: - 'hhea' table is now recalculated correctly - fixed wrong
assumption about sfnt resource names

1.0a1 (released 1999-04-27)
---------------------------

-  initial binary release for MacOS
