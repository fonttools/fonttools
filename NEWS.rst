3.3.1 (released 2016-12-15)
---------------------------

-  [setup] We no longer use versioneer.py to compute fonttools version
   from git metadata, as this has caused issues for some users (#767).
   Now we bump the version strings manually with a custom ``release``
   command of setup.py script.

---------------------------

-  [py23] optimized performance of round3 function; added backport for
   py35 math.isclose() (9d8dacb)

-  [subset] Fix subsetting MathVariants (78d3cbe)
-  [OS/2] Fix "Private Use (plane 15)" range (08a0d55). Thanks @mashabow

3.2.1 (released 2016-11-03)
---------------------------

-  [OS/2] fix checking ``fsSelection`` bits matching ``head.macStyle``
   bits
-  [varLib] added ``--build-HVAR`` option to generate ``HVAR`` table for
   fonts with TrueType outlines. For ``CFF2``, it is enabled by default.

3.2.0 (released 2016-11-02)
---------------------------

-  [varLib] Improve support for OpenType 1.8 Variable Fonts:
-  Implement GDEF's VariationStore
-  Implement HVAR/VVAR tables
-  Partial support for loading MutatorMath .designspace files with
   varLib.designspace module
-  Add varLib.models with Variation fonts interpolation models
-  Implement GSUB/GPOS FeatureVariations
-  Initial support for interpolating and merging OpenType Layout tables
   (see ``varLib.interpolate_layout`` and ``varLib.merger`` modules)
-  [API change] Change version to be an integer instead of a float in
   XML output for GSUB, GPOS, GDEF, MATH, BASE, JSTF, HVAR, VVAR, feat,
   hhea and vhea tables. Scripts that set the Version for those to 1.0
   or other float values also need fixing. A warning is emitted when
   code or XML needs fix.
-  several bug fixes to the cffLib module, contributed by Adobe's
   @readroberts
-  The XML output for CFF table now has a 'major' and 'minor' elements
   for specifying whether it's version 1.0 or 2.0 (support for CFF2 is
   coming soon)
-  [setup.py] remove undocumented/deprecated ``extra_path`` Distutils
   argument. This means that we no longer create a "FontTools" subfolder
   in site-packages containing the actual fontTools package, as well as
   the standalone xmlWriter and sstruct modules. The latter modules are
   also deprecated, and scheduled for removal in upcoming releases.
   Please change your import statements to point to from fontTools.misc
   import xmlWriter and from fontTools.misc import sstruct.
-  [scripts] Add a 'fonttools' command-line tool that simply runs
   ``fontTools.*`` sub-modules: e.g. ``fonttools ttx``,
   ``fonttools subset``, etc.
-  [hmtx/vmts] Read advance width/heights as unsigned short (uint16);
   automatically round float values to integers.
-  [ttLib/xmlWriter] add 'newlinestr=None' keyword argument to
   ``TTFont.saveXML`` for overriding os-specific line endings (passed on
   to ``XMLWriter`` instances).
-  [versioning] Use versioneer instead of ``setuptools_scm`` to
   dynamically load version info from a git checkout at import time.
-  [feaLib] Support backslash-prefixed glyph names.

3.1.2 (released 2016-09-27)

   ``--with-zopfli`` option to use Zopfli to compress WOFF 1.0 fonts.
-  [subset] Support subsetting 'COLR'/'CPAL' and 'CBDT'/'CBLC' color
   fonts tables, and 'gvar' table for variation fonts.
-  [Snippets] Add ``symfont.py``, for symbolic font statistics analysis;
   interpolatable.py, a preliminary script for detecting interpolation
   errors; ``{merge,dump}_woff_metadata.py``.
-  [classifyTools] Helpers to classify things into classes.
-  [CI] Run tests on Windows, Linux and macOS using Appveyor and Travis
   CI; check unit test coverage with Coverage.py/Coveralls; automatic
   deployment to PyPI on tags.
-  [loggingTools] Use Python built-in logging module to print messages.

-  Add support for loading, saving and ttx'ing WOFF file format
-  Add support for Microsoft COLR/CPAL layered color glyphs
-  Support PyPy
-  Support Jython, by replacing numpy with array/lists modules and
   removed it, pure-Python StringIO, not cStringIO
-  Add pyftsubset and Subsetter object, supporting CFF and TTF
-  Add to ttx args for -q for quiet mode, -z to choose a bitmap dump
   format

2.4 (released 2013-06-22)
-------------------------

-  Option to write to arbitrary files
-  Better dump format for DSIG
-  Better detection of OTF XML
-  Fix issue with Apple's kern table format
-  Fix mangling of TT glyph programs
-  Fix issues related to mona.ttf
-  Fix Windows Installer instructions
-  Fix some modern MacOS issues
-  Fix minor issues and typos

2.3 (released 2009-11-08)
-------------------------

-  TrueType Collection (TTC) support
-  Python 2.6 support
-  Update Unicode data to 5.2.0
-  Couple of bug fixes

2.2 (released 2008-05-18)
-------------------------

-  ClearType support
-  cmap format 1 support
-  PFA font support
-  Switched from Numeric to numpy
-  Update Unicode data to 5.1.0
-  Update AGLFN data to 1.6
-  Many bug fixes

2.1 (released 2008-01-28)
-------------------------

-  Many years worth of fixes and features

2.0b2 (released 2002-??-??)
---------------------------

-  Be "forgiving" when interpreting the maxp table version field:
   interpret any value as 1.0 if it's not 0.5. Fixes dumping of these
   GPL fonts: http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/pds.cgi?ports/chinese/wangttf
-  Fixed ttx -l: it turned out this part of the code didn't work with
   Python 2.2.1 and earlier. My bad to do most of my testing with a
   different version than I shipped TTX with :-(
-  Fixed bug in ClassDef format 1 subtable (Andreas Seidel bumped into
   this one).

2.0b1 (released 2002-09-10)
---------------------------

-  Fixed embarrassing bug: the master checksum in the head table is now
   calculated correctly even on little-endian platforms (such as Intel).
-  Made the cmap format 4 compiler smarter: the binary data it creates
   is now more or less as compact as possible. TTX now makes more
   compact data than in any shipping font I've tested it with.
-  Dump glyph names as a separate "GlyphOrder" pseudo table as opposed
   to as part of the glyf table (obviously needed for CFF-OTF's).
-  Added proper support for the CFF table.
-  Don't barf on empty tables (questionable, but "there are font out
   there...")
-  When writing TT glyf data, align glyphs on 4-byte boundaries. This
   seems to be the current recommendation by MS. Also: don't barf on
   fonts which are already 4-byte aligned.
-  Windows installer contributed bu Adam Twardoch! Yay!
-  Changed the command line interface again, now by creating one new
   tool replacing the old ones: ttx It dumps and compiles, depending on
   input file types. The options have changed somewhat.
-  The -d option is back (output dir)
-  ttcompile's -i options is now called -m (as in "merge"), to avoid
   clash with dump's -i.
-  The -s option ("split tables") no longer creates a directory, but
   instead outputs a small .ttx file containing references to the
   individual table files. This is not a true link, it's a simple file
   name, and the referenced file should be in the same directory so
   ttcompile can find them.
-  compile no longer accepts a directory as input argument. Instead it
   can parse the new "mini-ttx" format as output by "ttx -s".
-  all arguments are input files
-  Renamed the command line programs and moved them to the Tools
   subdirectory. They are now installed by the setup.py install script.
-  Added OpenType support. BASE, GDEF, GPOS, GSUB and JSTF are (almost)
   fully supported. The XML output is not yet final, as I'm still
   considering to output certain subtables in a more human-friendly
   manner.
-  Fixed 'kern' table to correctly accept subtables it doesn't know
   about, as well as interpreting Apple's definition of the 'kern' table
   headers correctly.
-  Fixed bug where glyphnames were not calculated from 'cmap' if it was
   (one of the) first tables to be decompiled. More specifically: it
   cmap was the first to ask for a glyphID -> glyphName mapping.
-  Switched XML parsers: use expat instead of xmlproc. Should be faster.
-  Removed my UnicodeString object: I now require Python 2.0 or up,
   which has unicode support built in.
-  Removed assert in glyf table: redundant data at the end of the table
   is now ignored instead of raising an error. Should become a warning.
-  Fixed bug in hmtx/vmtx code that only occured if all advances were
   equal.
-  Fixed subtle bug in TT instruction disassembler.
-  Couple of fixes to the 'post' table.
-  Updated OS/2 table to latest spec.

1.0b1 (released 2001-08-10)
---------------------------

-  Reorganized the command line interface for ttDump.py and
   ttCompile.py, they now behave more like "normal" command line tool,
   in that they accept multiple input files for batch processing.
-  ttDump.py and ttCompile.py don't silently override files anymore, but
   ask before doing so. Can be overridden by -f.
-  Added -d option to both ttDump.py and ttCompile.py.
-  Installation is now done with distutils. (Needs work for environments
   without compilers.)
-  Updated installation instructions.
-  Added some workarounds so as to handle certain buggy fonts more
   gracefully.
-  Updated Unicode table to Unicode 3.0 (Thanks Antoine!)
-  Included a Python script by Adam Twardoch that adds some useful stuff
   to the Windows registry.
-  Moved the project to SourceForge.

1.0a6 (released 2000-03-15)
---------------------------

-  Big reorganization: made ttLib a subpackage of the new fontTools
   package, changed several module names. Called the entire suite
   "FontTools"
-  Added several submodules to fontTools, some new, some older.
-  Added experimental CFF/GPOS/GSUB support to ttLib, read-only (but XML
   dumping of GPOS/GSUB is for now disabled)
-  Fixed hdmx endian bug
-  Added -b option to ttCompile.py, it disables recalculation of
   bounding boxes, as requested by Werner Lemberg.
-  Renamed tt2xml.pt to ttDump.py and xml2tt.py to ttCompile.py
-  Use ".ttx" as file extension instead of ".xml".
-  TTX is now the name of the XML-based *format* for TT fonts, and not
   just an application.

1.0a5
-----

Never released

-  More tables supported: hdmx, vhea, vmtx

1.0a3 & 1.0a4
-------------

Never released

-  fixed most portability issues
-  retracted the "Euro_or_currency" change from 1.0a2: it was
   nonsense!

1.0a2 (released 1999-05-02)
---------------------------

-  binary release for MacOS
-  genenates full FOND resources: including width table, PS font name
   info and kern table if applicable.
-  added cmap format 4 support. Extra: dumps Unicode char names as XML
   comments!
-  added cmap format 6 support
-  now accepts true type files starting with "true" (instead of just
   0x00010000 and "OTTO")
-  'glyf' table support is now complete: I added support for composite
   scale, xy-scale and two-by-two for the 'glyf' table. For now,
   component offset scale behaviour defaults to Apple-style. This only
   affects the (re)calculation of the glyph bounding box.
-  changed "Euro" to "Euro_or_currency" in the Standard Apple Glyph
   order list, since we cannot tell from the 'post' table which is
   meant. I should probably doublecheck with a Unicode encoding if
   available. (This does not affect the output!)

Fixed bugs: - 'hhea' table is now recalculated correctly - fixed wrong
assumption about sfnt resource names

1.0a1 (released 1999-04-27)
---------------------------

-  initial binary release for MacOS
