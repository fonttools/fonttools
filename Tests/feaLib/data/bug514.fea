# The many chain targets for this feature should get combined into
# two separate SinglePos lookups: {A:-40, B:-40, C:-40} and {A:-111}.
# https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/514
#
# makeotf produces {A:-40, B:-40, C:-40} and {A:-111, B:-40} which
# is redundant. https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/afdko/issues/169
